## Download DEM in QGIS
1. Add OpenTopography plugin
2. Open Raster -> OpenTopography
3. Define extent (can be from existing layer)
4. Download
5. (Remember to use an appropriate Z factor when plotting hillshade)

## Download DEM from web

1. SRTM digital elevation models can be downloaded from the [USGS earth explorer site][link1] (for this you need to register and make an account).

2. Using the map zoom to your area of interest, under the search criteria tab you can choose the map extent. 

3. Navigate to `Data Sets -> Digital elevation -> SRTM` and choose a dataset. SRTM 1 Arc-Second global provides void-filled worldwide coverage at a resolution of 30 metres. The data acquisition date is February 2000. More information on acquisition and processing can be found [here.][link2]

4. Download all of the files that cover your region of interest in GeoTIFF format. If your region spans multiple tiles these can be mosaicked in QGIS using: `Raster > Miscellaneous > Merge`

5. Clipping the DEM to a manageable size can also be done in QGIS, choose: `Layer > Create Layer > New Shapefile Layer`. Create a polygon layer. Right click the new layer, toggle editting on, and draw a box around the region you want to clip to. Choose: `Raster > Extraction > Clip Layer by Extent`. Use your merged DEM as the input layer and your new shapefile as the clipping extent.
